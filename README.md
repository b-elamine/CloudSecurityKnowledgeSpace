# Cloud Security Knowledge Space
Interactive visualization of a tripartite security knowledge space structured by security categories, security perspectives, and abstraction models.

This repository contains a small interactive artifact developed in the context of PhD research on the structural organization of security knowledge in cloud and distributed systems.
The work addresses the difficulty of reasoning about cloud security when concerns are simultaneously distributed across:

- different security domains (e.g. data, network, access control),
- different analytical perspectives (requirements, challenges, issues, solutions)
- different levels of abstraction or responsibility (user, application, platform, rule, detection).

Rather than enumerating all possible combinations of these dimensions, the research proposes to structure the security space itself !
